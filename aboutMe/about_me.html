          <p style="color:rgb(202, 201, 201)">
            My name is James and I am 24 years old. <br>
            I grew up in the Midwest, in Minnesota for the majority of my life. <br>
            I moved to Oregon in the summer of 2018 because I have always loved Oregon and all that comes along with it. <br>
            I am currently going to school to further my longterm carreer goals. I am loving the classes I have taken at COCC so far and I am dedicated to learning more.<br>
            I also am going to school to expand my learning and abilities for my own desire for information. I have always felt that no one can stop you from learning but having the tools of school accable certainly help to push that intellectual curriousity.<br>
            Anyways I hope whoever views my profile sees the energy and passion I have put into this process. I am loving learning about programming and computer science!<br>
            Thank You<br> Sincerely,<br>
            James Moorhead

            <h2>Where I was born</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small town called<a hrer="http://parkrapids.com/">Park Rapids Minnesota</a>. Its a fairly small town with a large majority of the income coming from seasonal tourism.<br>
            I never spent much time there unless visiting my Grandma or a couple of cousins.

            <h2>Where I grew up</h2>
            <p>I grew up all over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota">Minnesota</a>
            but the majority of my time was spent living in<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota">Duluth</a>. It's a port town located on the south western corner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior">Lake Superior</a>. It's a beautiful town although it can be known to be extremely cold!(Mainly during the Winter :D ) <br>
            The majority of my family does live in Minnesota still and while I do miss them at times I dont miss the drastic weather and the small town mentality of the Midwest. Also since I also have family here on the west coast regardless of where I reside someone is left halfway across the country!

            <h2>My passions</h2>
            <p>While my passions are ever changing and largely kept to myself, I am full of passions and wonder. I have a curiousity to know how things work and why they are done that way.<br>
            1)Problem solving has always been a passion of mine. Whether its figuring out a faster way to solve a problem or simply working through the mass of problems life seems to throw at me or those around me daily. <br>
            2)Another passion for me is and always will be music. Whether it is making it or listening I love to hear creativity and passion played through music of any genre. But, with that I am very picky and have found very few who can see my attraction to what most wouldn't give a second look. For instance my top 5 all time favorites artists would be:<br>
            <!--******************ADD ARTIST PAGE LINKS!!!!!!!!-->
            1)Bob Dylan 2)BECK 3)MF DOOM 4)Van Morrison 5)John Frusciante.<br>
            While some might recognize a few, very few could recognize more than 3 without further research and these are simply the few that have always been my favorites. I grew with an appetite for music and wanted nothing but seek the purist of music and artist. To me these all represent purity of the art and all deserve homage. That to me is what makes something worth my time and energy for music! (I also know music is subjective and always try to keep that in my head with others knowing very rarely will people agree on what is generaly "The Best")<br>
            Lastly I have a huge respect for literature of all sides of the spectrum and have explored many genres and time periods. But, I usually find myself tending to lean towards the writings of only a few. I enjoy mostly all Mark Twains works, especially his collection of short stories! I also love reading about the "Tao" generally leaning more towards the writings following more closely to the original writing then the more reinterpreted versions seen more recently. I enjoy proding the mind with obscure ideas and even though many would say there's nothing more to it than allegory and stories I like to consider all works of religion and spirituality while potentially false in their methodology or logic, all carry certain truths that are relevant regardless of where we are as a society or personally.<br>
            (I also believe in ranting!)
